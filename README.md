# MAGFest Swadges

ESP8266 Firmware for the MAGFest 2017 swadges.  See more at http://magbadge.me/

We hope to some day make them badges, but until we get the proper approvals, they will stay the swadges they are.

## General Features

The swadges (swag-badges) are wifi-interconnected human-interface battery-operated devices.  They've got lights, buttons and all check in to our server whenever they can find a MAGFest wifi connection.  This means we can monitor your swadge's health, what wifi connections are around it, button presses and send it colors.  If you go to a main stage concert, the swadges will be controlled in unison by the light show maestro.  The rest swadge's features will be unlocked over the course of the fest.  Come to the "Get to know your wifi swadge panel" to learn more about your swadge, games that are upcoming and available --- and to hear the back story of how these devices came to be.

By the way! If it is too far from the main wifi networks, all lights turn dim red and it goes to sleep for a while so you don't need to pull the batteries out overnight.  Also, you can hold the LEFT button while powering it on, it turns into a flashlight.  If you're inclined to tinkering, the badges have a 'development' mode built in, but you'll have to go to the forge or the swadge panel to learn more.

## Startup Button Features

Remove power, press button, apply power.  This can be done by pressing the button you want to select, and popping a battery down on its spring in the back.  This will cause the ESP to reboot and the button to be detected on startup.  You can easily reboot the ESP by bumping the battery to one side to make it disconnect and reconnect.

 * Right = Enter serial programming mode on startup where you can use the 4-pin connector to load new firmware on the badge.
 * Left = Turn magbadge into magtorch.  Disables all wifi functionality.
 * Up or Start = Disable deep sleep.  This will cause the badge to still work in concerts even if there is a failure of the infrastructure.
 * Select = Make badge enter AP mode (Will be called "MAGBADGE") where you can connect to it and use it as a rudimentry development platform.  If you wanna do some hacking! 


## Protocol

All communication is performed either by raw 802.11n packet access and/or once connected to a network, UDP packets.  Packets by default are sent specifically to 10.201.0.10, port 8000.  If there are specifically solicited packets, they will return from whence they came, so you do not need to be 10.201.0.10.  Under normal circumstances, though, the badge only connects to this server.

Status updates are sent to the server, responded to and/or 802.11n broadcasted whenever:

 * Badge connects to network
 * Every 10 seconds
 * Upon request (Send badge a 0x01 message)
 * Every time a user clicks a button.


```
	//PROTOCOL:

	// MAC from the server is ignored.
	//Starting at byte 6.

	//Packets can come from anywhere.
	//Packets send packets to device on port 8001

## Pinouts

The 4-pin programming header pinout is pin 1 (Bottom) up: GND / RX / TX / VCC.  When programming do not connect batteries and VCC at the same time.

To enter programming mode, press and hold right, and remove and reapply power.  This can be easily done by popping the battery to the side.

The GPIO buttons are: 
  * Bit 0: RIGHT = GPIO0
  * Bit 1: DOWN = GPIO2
  * Bit 2: LEFT = GPIO12
  * Bit 3: UP = GPIO13
  * Bit 4: SELECT = GPIO14
  * Bit 5: START = GPIO15
  * Bit 6: B = GPIO4
  * Bit 7: A = GPIO5
